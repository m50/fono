# Fono

[![Mergify Status][mergify-status]][mergify]

A free-and-open-source wifi speaker system.

Think of Sonos, but completely DIY.

Fono offers all the software components necessary to self-host a distributed and
groupable speaker setup in your house. Unlike Sonos though, it is BYOS (bring
your own speakers), so be prepared to set everything up yourself, and have a
server you can host the control panel locally.
